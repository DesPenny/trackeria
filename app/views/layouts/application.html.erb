  <ul>
  <li>This tool tracks the top 100 search results for a given URL & keyword.</li>
  <li>Non-website search results (news, images, etc.) appearing before your URL in a search will be included when determining your search ranking. </li>
  <li>Rankings are updated and saved automatically each day.</li>
  <li>The Country selected for a URL/Keyword determines the country specific search engine used (ca.yahoo.com, google.fr, etc). However all searches are performed from USA IP addresses. Also Alexa Global Rankings are always used regardless of Country selected.</li>
